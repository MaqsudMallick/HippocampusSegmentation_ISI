# Hippocampus Segmentation using ensemble of Deep Learning Methods
Medical images have made a great impact on medicine diagnosis and treatment. 3D and 2D image
segmentation plays an important role in biomedical image analysis. However each segmentation
model has its own strengths and weaknesses but by unifying them together we may be able to predict
more accurate results. In this project, we present a method to segment biomedical images using an
ensemble of deep learning segmentation architectures. We have made general n layer models to
ensure scalability of the architectures and segment larger images like that of Lungs or Liver Computed
Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging to detect minute tumors and deformities. We have
trained three models, namely U-Net, U-Net++ modified by us and ResNet-50 backbone with U-Net++.
We have applied our ensemble technique on the Brain MRI Dataset for Hippocampus segmentation
which is part of the Medical Image Segmentation Decathlon Challenge.
